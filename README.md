# Social-listener
Social activity monitor for Instagram, vk.com, and telegram with a telegram bot for it. 

# Architecture design
Social activity monitor will have some goals that must be done, to say that this project is working.

# Open questions:
- Will be a web application or a bot for telegram?
 Maybe it will be both of this, we must investigate what will be better and easly to use.
- Backend side is probably the biggest problem, because the system must work 24/7 and have functional to autostart and work with errors.
- Validation on fields and text.
- DB must be free licensed. 

# Functions:
The first point will be to work with Instagram because we cant see online of users, but we can see is the account private/public and how much photos, followers, and following are.
